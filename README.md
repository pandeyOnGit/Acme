Acme - Next.js Demo Application
Acme is a demo web application built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It was created as part of my learning process while following a Next.js tutorial. The application includes key pages and features such as a home page, dashboard, invoices, customers, and revenue.

Features
Home Page: The landing page of the application with an overview and navigation options.
Dashboard: Provides a summary of key data and metrics.
Invoices: Allows users to view and manage invoices.
Customers: Manage and view customer data.
Revenue: Displays revenue information.
Tech Stack
Next.js: A React framework for building static and server-side rendered applications.
TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript, providing better development and debugging support.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs without having to leave your HTML.
pnpm: A fast, disk space-efficient package manager.
Live Demo
You can view the live demo of the application hosted on Vercel: Acme Demo

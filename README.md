# **Acme - Next.js Demo Application**

Acme is a **demo web application** built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It was created as part of my learning process while following a Next.js tutorial. The application includes key pages and features such as a home page, dashboard, invoices, customers, and revenue.

## **Features**
- **Home Page**: The landing page of the application with an overview and navigation options.
- **Dashboard**: Provides a summary of key data and metrics.
- **Invoices**: Allows users to view and manage invoices.
- **Customers**: Manage and view customer data.
- **Revenue**: Displays revenue information.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building static and server-side rendered applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript, providing better development and debugging support.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs without having to leave your HTML.
- **pnpm**: A fast, disk space-efficient package manager.

## **Live Demo**
